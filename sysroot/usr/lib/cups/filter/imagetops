# imagetops - This is a Image-to-PostScript filter for CUPS
#
# Note: This wrapper filter is only included for backward compatibility with
# certan custom configurations. It is not mentioned in any of the .convs
# files included in this package and therefore never used with the default
# configuration. It makes sure that third-party PPD files referring to
# imagetops explicitly or custom configurations (in /etc/cups/*.convs files)
# will not break.
#
# DO NOT create new PPD or .convs files using this filter! imagetops is
# DEPRECATED!
