# This is a systemd tmpfiles.d configuration file
#
# tmpfiles.d defaults are set to clean /run/user every now and then
# which includes our gvfs-fuse mount being mounted in /run/user/<id>/gvfs
#
# This file adds an exclusion rule so that user data don't get automatically
# cleaned up (i.e. destroyed).
#
# Due to our fuse mount restrictions root can't access nor stat the mountpoint
# resulting in warning spitted out by the systemd-tmpfiles process. Please
# ignore it for the time being until proper solution is found:
