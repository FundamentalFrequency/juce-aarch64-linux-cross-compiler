Description: Pygame Zero
        ===========
        
        A zero-boilerplate games programming framework for Python 3, based on Pygame.
        
        Some examples
        -------------
        
        Pygame Zero consists of a runner ``pgzrun`` that will run a Pygame Zero script
        with a full game loop and a range of useful builtins.
        
        Here's some of the neat stuff you can do. Note that each of these is a
        self-contained script. There's no need for any imports or anything else in the
        file.
        
        Draw graphics (assuming there's  a file like ``images/dog.png`` or
        ``images/dog.jpg``)::
        
            def draw():
                screen.clear()
                screen.blit('dog', (10, 50))
        
        Play the sound ``sounds/eep.wav`` when you click the mouse::
        
            def on_mouse_down():
                sounds.eep.play()
        
        Draw an "actor" object (with the sprite ``images/alien.png``) that moves across
        the screen::
        
            alien = Actor('alien')
            alien.pos = 10, 10
        
            def draw():
                screen.clear()
                alien.draw()
        
            def update():
                alien.x += 1
                if alien.left > WIDTH:
                    alien.right = 0
