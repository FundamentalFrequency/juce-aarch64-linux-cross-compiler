        The Pimoroni Enviro pHAT boast a plethora of sensors and connectivity
        for measuring your environment.
        
        Enviro pHAT includes:
        
        -  An LSM303D accelerometer/magnetometer for detecting orientation,
           motion and heading
        -  A BMP280 temperature/pressure sensor
        -  A TCS3472 colour sensor, for detecting the amount and colour of light
        -  An ADS1015 analog sensor with four 3.3v tolerant channels for your
           external sensors
        -  A 5v power supply pin for powering your sensors, which you can
           regulate or divide to 3v if needed
        -  Two LEDs connected to GPIO #4 for illuminating objects over the
           colour sensor
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        Full install (recommended):
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        We've created an easy installation script that will install all
        pre-requisites and get your Enviro pHAT up and running with minimal
        efforts. To run it, fire up Terminal which you'll find in Menu ->
        Accessories -> Terminal on your Raspberry Pi desktop, as illustrated
        below:
        
        .. figure:: http://get.pimoroni.com/resources/github-repo-terminal.png
           :alt: Finding the terminal
        
        In the new terminal window type the command exactly as it appears below
        (check for typos) and follow the on-screen instructions:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            curl https://get.pimoroni.com/envirophat | bash
        
        Alternatively, on Raspbian, you can download the ``pimoroni-dashboard``
        and install your product by browsing to the relevant entry:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sudo apt-get install pimoroni
        
        (you will find the Dashboard under 'Accessories' too, in the Pi menu -
        or just run ``pimoroni-dashboard`` at the command line)
        
        If you choose to download examples you'll find them in
        ``/home/pi/Pimoroni/envirophat/``.
        
        Manual install:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Library install for Python 3:
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        on Raspbian:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sudo apt-get install python3-envirophat
        
        other environments:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sudo pip3 install envirophat
        
        Library install for Python 2:
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        on Raspbian:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sudo apt-get install python-envirophat
        
        other environments:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sudo pip2 install envirophat
        
        Development:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you want to contribute, or like living on the edge of your seat by
        having the latest code, you should clone this repository, ``cd`` to the
        library directory, and run:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sudo python3 setup.py install
        
        (or ``sudo python setup.py install`` whichever your primary Python
        environment may be)
        
        In all cases you will have to enable the i2c bus.
