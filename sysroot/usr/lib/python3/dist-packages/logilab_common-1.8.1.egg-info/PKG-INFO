        What's this ?
        -------------
        
        This package contains some modules used by different Logilab projects.
        
        It is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License.
        
        There is no documentation available yet but the source code should be clean and
        well documented.
        
        Designed to ease:
        
        * handling command line options and configuration files
        * writing interactive command line tools
        * manipulation of files and character strings
        * manipulation of common structures such as graph, tree, and pattern such as visitor
        * generating text and HTML reports
        * more...
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        Documentation is available at https://logilab-common.readthedocs.io/
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        logilab-common is available on pypi so you can install it using pip ::
        
            pip install logilab-common
        
        Or alternatively extract the tarball, jump into the created directory and run ::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        For installation options, see ::
        
            python setup.py install --help
        
        
        Building the documentation
        --------------------------
        
        Create a virtualenv and install dependencies ::
        
            virtualenv venv
            source venv/bin/activate
        
            # you need the krb5-config command to build all dependencies
            # on debian you can get it using "apt-get install libkrb5-dev"
        
            pip install doc/requirements-doc.txt
        
            # install logilab-common
            pip install -e .
        
        Then build the doc ::
        
            cd doc
            make html
        
        It's now available under `doc/_build/html/`
        
        Code style
        ----------
        
        The python code is verified against *flake8* and formatted with *black*.
        
        * You can run `tox -e black` to check that the files are well formatted.
        * You can run `tox -e black-run` to format them if needed.
        * You can include the `.hgrc` to your own `.hgrc` to automatically run black
          before each commit/amend. This can be done by writing `%include ../.hgrc` at
          the end of your `.hgrc`.
